While studying bioinformatics for several years, I begin to rethink about the career on bioinformatics.
From my personal idea, people on bioinformatics can be roughly divided into two groups:

1. those who standing on the area of data analysis to study biological problems.
2. those who standing on the area of biology, and use bioinformatics just as one specific tools.

I hear lots of people say that it's very interesting to study bioinformatics since it's an interdiscipline, and you can learn both the information science and biology science. People say it's much easier to find jobs and also escape the painstaking "wet experiments".

**I have to say this idea is quite dangerous either for your looking for jobs or your science career !**

Why? Simply because either information science or biology science takes you muuuuuch time if you want to be an expert on one of them. And if you miss your standing position, i.e., you don't choose 1 or 2 as your position or final goal, you will quickly find that you cannot go further either on science or jobs. For science, you need to ask important biological questions by collaborating with experts on biology or by yourself. The former needs you to be experts on data analysis or else why experts on biology will work with you, and the latter needs yourself to be a biological scientist.
