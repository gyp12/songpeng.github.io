When you want to find jobs on codings or simply to improve your coding capacity on algorithms and data structure, you must know [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com). It contains hundreds of coding problems frequently asked by your interviewers. Some of them are basic, and some of them are very hard. You can submit your solutions online, and then you will get your result: whether you finish the basic requests or not, and how about your codes compared with others'.


If you use Github (you don't know it or you don't use it? Hmm....), I highly recommend [haoel's repository on Leetcode](https://github.com/haoel/leetcode). He writes his own solutions (currently mainly on C++) on almost every problem, and this repository has own more than two thousand stars. Yes, haoel is an famous expert on programming. [Here is his blogs](https://coolshell.cn/haoel), but it is in Chinese.

It's not over. I found an App named "CodeHub" on Iphone through which you can log in the github on your personal phone. So you can study haoel's (maybe others') codes anywhere.

Reading experts' codes is one of the most important way to learn how to write the right codes. Let's start!
