## Introduction
Recently several papers talked about using the queries data from the search engine (such as Google, Baidu) to predict the socks or fluenze.
1. How did it work?
2. Is it reliable?
3. What can we learn from them?
4. Are new statistic methods or computational algorithms are needed in this direction or in the future?
