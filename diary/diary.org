1. /Learning multiple layers of representation (By Hinton, 2007)/
   + *Explain away* phenomenon in directed network, i.e., v-structure, which may result in the computational challenging when training.
   + Unsupervised, undirected, layer by layer, and fine-tune network learning.
2. /Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives (By Bengio, 2012)/
